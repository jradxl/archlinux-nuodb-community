Archlinux NuoDB Community
=========================

Installation Package for NuoDB, a NewSQL database, www.nuodb.com

This is an installation package, and does not build the source.
NuoDB is not open source, but their professional version allows installations with one or two hosts for free, and with a production licence. NuoDB do not make their download repository obvious. This installation package does use their download server, but it is unclear as to whether it is acceptable to NuoDB.

NuoDB do not support a server running on Arch Linux, but as it is a Java application it sure does work.

Not fully finished yet, but it does install and start/stop for me.
